					<h5>Take-Aways</h5>
					<p>One thing sticks out to me: There are substantially more open positions for mid-level developers than either other category.
						<br>This proves wrong an assumption I held. A commonly held assumption is that every company has an opening for a senior developer, even companies that aren't actually trying to hire. The reasoning is that senior developers are so hard to find,
						that companies sohuld always be receptive to hiring them. There is only one outlier market where there are more senior roles than mid, and that is Chicago. If I had to offer speculation, I would say it may be due to the algorithmic/high frequency
						trading industry in Chicago, where a programmatic error can cost <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight_Capital_Group#2012_stock_trading_disruption">millions of dollars</a>. But I have not done the analysis to back that up.
					</p>
					<p>One other observation is that there are extremely few Junior/Entry level roles. I find it shocking that New York only has two, and that the SF Bay Area has none.

					<h5>Steps involved in the creation of this page:</h5>
					<ol>
						<li> Wrote a Web Scraper in Ruby that searches Indeed.com for the job title "Ruby developer", constrained to jobs posted in the last 29 days</li>
						<li> As part of the script, I saved the data that I extracted to a local SQLite database</li>
						<li>
							<ul>Used SQL to clean the dataset
								<li>For example I removed Design and Marketing jobs and Internships. I also removed DevOps roles, a decision that was more difficult to make</li>
								<li>I removed zip code numbers from the Location field, since a small percentage of Indeed listings show the zip code too</li>
								<li>Also had to filter for uniqueness. The injected 'sponsored' job listings may reappear across different pages. Although this was minimized by specifying 100 results per page </li>
							</ul>
							<li id="fourth_step"> Brought into Excel for sanity check. Here I consolidated cities into greater metro regions, and removed some small results entirely</li>
							<li> Finally, created a website with ChartJS, and got it hosted</li>
					</ol>
